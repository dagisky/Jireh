DSCR loan is a type of loan commonly used in commercial real estate financing. The Debt Service Coverage Ratio is a financial metric that indicates a property's ability to cover its debt obligations.

In simpler terms, the DSCR loan considers the income generated by the property (usually rental income) compared to the debt payments (mortgage) associated with it. Lenders typically look for a DSCR of 1.25 or higher, meaning that the property's income should be 1.25 times the amount of the debt payments.

Note: This loan does not require income verification of the owner. But being unable to pay and if the property goes into foreclosure it will affect the owners credit score negatively.

To qualify for a DSCR loan, you typically need:

1. Strong rental income: Lenders will want to see that the property generates sufficient income to cover the debt payments comfortably.    
2. **Good creditworthiness:** Just like with any loan, your credit history and credit score will be evaluated to determine your eligibility and the terms of the loan.    
3. **Down payment**: You'll likely need to provide a down payment, which can vary depending on the lender and the specifics of the loan.    
4. **Property evaluation**: The lender will assess the property to determine its value and potential income generation    
5. **Business plan or property performance history**: If the property is already generating income, the lender may want to see historical performance or a business plan outlining how you intend to generate income from the property.
6. **Personal financial information**: Lenders may require personal financial statements to assess your overall financial health and ability to repay the loan.

These are just general requirements, and the specifics can vary depending on the lender and the individual circumstances of the loan application.


## Protecting yourself from being negatively impacted if the property goes under foreclosure

Structuring the ownership of the property under an LLC (Limited Liability Company) owned by a holding company can potentially help protect your personal credit score in the event of default on a DSCR loan
