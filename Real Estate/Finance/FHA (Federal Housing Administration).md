## FHA Mortgage Loans
FHA home loans are government-backed mortgage loans that give Americans with low credit scores or a lack of funds the opportunity to purchase a home with only a small down payment.

As opposed to a traditional loan, 3 parties are involved in an FHA home loan: 

- Borrower
- Lender
- Federal Housing Administration (FHA)

The FHA’s involvement provides security for both sides, reducing the lender’s risk and helping the borrower get approved for the loan.

### Why take out an FHA Mortgage Loan

From a home buyer’s perspective, the main reasons to apply for an FHA home loan are:
-  If you’ve been rejected by traditional lenders
-  If you don’t have sufficient money for a 20% down payment
